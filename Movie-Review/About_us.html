    <p style="color: #2fa1e2">ShowOnHepflix is the one of the top rated site which reviews the movies that have been already released or is going to release in the near future. We had the top critics that of our industry who reviews the movies wthout getting biased by any kind.</p>
    <p style="color: #2fa1e2">The website is owned by <b>Mr. Aditya Gupta</b> who is pursuing his bachelor's degree in CSE(DS). He is from Gorakhpur and has completed his schooling from <a href="http://www.rpmacademycivilines.org/default.asp">RPM Academy</a>. He is in <a href="https://www.abes.ac.in/">ABES Engineering College</a> for his B.Tech. </p>
    <p style="color: #2fa1e2">The title and talent pages of ShowOnHepflix are accessible to all users, but only registered and logged-in users can submit new material and suggest edits to existing entries. Most of the site's data has been provided by these volunteers. Registered users with a proven track record are able to add and make corrections to cast lists, credits, and some other data points. However, the addition and removal of images, and alterations to titles, cast and crew names, character names, and plot summaries are subject to an approval process; this usually takes between 24 and 72 hours.</p>

    <p style="color: #2fa1e2"> Registered users can choose their username, and most are pseudonymous. There is no single index of contributors, no index on each profile page of the items contributed, and—except for plot synopses and biographies—no identification of contributors to each product's or person's data pages. Users are also invited to rate titles on a scale of 1 to 10, and the totals are converted into a weighted mean-rating, with filters in place to mitigate ballot-stuffing.</p>
        
      <p style="color: #2fa1e2">  User profile pages show a user's registration date and, optionally, their personal ratings of titles. Since 2015, "badges" can be added showing a count of contributions. These badges range from total contributions made to independent categories such as photos, trivia, and biographies. If a registered user or visitor is in the entertainment industry and has an ShowOnHepflix page, they can add photos through ShowOnHepflixPRO.</p><br>
